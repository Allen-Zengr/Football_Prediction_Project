## Aims and Objectives

Through collection of past football data, a model was to be built that satisfied the following two objectives, one quantitative and one qualitative:

- Achieve a test accuracy of greater than 50%, with a stretch target of 60%.
- Output probabilities that appear sensible/realistic, that are comparable to odds offered on popular betting websites.


## Dataset

The data was collected directly from an API:<a href="https://www.api-football.com/" target="_blank"> api-football</a>. This was preferred over a static database that can be readily found online, due to the following:

- API calls can be made daily, refreshing the database with the most recent statistics and results, to consistently retrain the model on up-to-date information.
- The API not only provides past game data but information on upcoming games, essential to make predictions which feed into the web application.
