## Aims and Objectives

Through collection of past football data, a model was to be built that satisfied the following two objectives, one quantitative and one qualitative:

- Achieve a test accuracy of greater than 50%, with a stretch target of 60%.
- Output probabilities that appear sensible/realistic, that are comparable to odds offered on popular betting websites.


## Dataset

The data was collected directly from an API:<a href="https://www.api-football.com/" target="_blank"> api-football</a>. This was preferred over a static database that can be readily found online, due to the following:

- API calls can be made daily, refreshing the database with the most recent statistics and results, to consistently retrain the model on up-to-date information.
- The API not only provides past game data but information on upcoming games, essential to make predictions which feed into the web application.


## Data Cleaning and Preparation

Data was initially collected from the 2019-2020 premier league season, in the form of a single json file per fixture containing a range of stats (e.g. number of shots, possession etc.) These json files were loaded into a Pandas DataFrame, and organised into a nested dictionary in the following form: `{team ID: {fixture_id: stats_df}}` 

Execution of `01_api_data_request.py` and `02_cleaning_stats_data.py` will update the database with recently played fixtures and add these DataFrames directly to the nested dictionary described above. 

## Feature Engineering and Data Visualisation

In order to utilise as much previous match data as possible, whilst minimising the number of features, match data was averaged over the previous 10 games to predict an upcoming fixture. To understand how well a single team is performing, their average stats were subtracted from their opponentâ€™s average stats, to produce a difference metric e.g. number of shots difference. A team with `number_of_shots_diff = 2` has taken on average 2 more shots than their opponent in the previous 10 games. Seven 'difference' features were chosen:

- Goal Difference
- Shot Difference
- Shots Inside The Box Difference
- Posession Difference
- Pass Accuracy Difference
- Corners Difference
- Fouls Difference

The above describes the features for a single team, hence the number of features is doubled to 14 when predicting a match. Like-for-like features were visualised in the following cross-plot, and demonstate that the chosen features have some influence on the outcome of a match, with the execption of number of fouls, which appears to have little correlation with the target result.

## Model Selection and Training

A range of algorithms were selected and tested from the module scikit-learn. All models were optimised using a grid search with a 5-fold cross-validation accuracy metric. The top 3 performing algorithms explored in this report are:
- Decision Trees
- Support Vector Machine
- K-Nearest Neighbour


## Evaluation

Along with cross-validation accuracy, confusion matrices were initially used to evaluate model performance, displayed in figure 2 below.

<em>Figure 2. (a) Confusion matrix of the random forest model, (b) confusion matrix of the nearest neighbour model, (c) confusion matrix of the SVM model </em>

Immediate inspection of these matrices shows all three models are performing poorly when predicting a draw. Both nearest neighbour and SVM are more incorrect that correct when predicting a draw and the random forest classifier only predicts a single draw from nearly 300 fixtures. To understand why this was occurring, the features as displayed in figure 1 were re-plotted to display only draws. It was hypothesised that equally matched teams would draw more often and therefore data clusters were expected around the dashed red line denoting equally matched teams. It is clear however, that in this database, containing results from 2019 and 2020, that the distribution of drawn matches appears somewhat randomly. Given the relative infrequency of draws (approx. 1 in 5 matches) and the random nature of the outcome in this database, itis no surprise the models do a poor job of predicting them.
